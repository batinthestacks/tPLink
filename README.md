# tPLink
Interacting with TPlink home automation products via perl

I haven't taken the time to fiddle with(learn) python but the only examples of controlling TP-Link products are written in it. This is my messy implementation in perl. Will be implementing the full set of commands but starting this reporitory with what I got working in one night.

This code currently works with the LB100 and LB130 bulbs. HS100 switch commands are in there and will be implemented shortly.

Based on and many thanks to:
